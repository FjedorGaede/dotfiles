Here I gather idead and todos to improve my dotfiles.

## TMUX_SESSIONIZER
- [x] Make the sessionizer only search through open windows in tmux when i press `Ctrl+Shift+F` instead of all directories -> I actually have built that but this for some reason did not work. I could not set a keybinding for it. Maybe when I use zsh

## ZSH
- [ ] I really want to use this and have autocomplete working

## FZF
- [ ] I should look up what I can build with this. This would be so cool.

## YAZI
- [x] bring first version of yazi -> actually really cool
