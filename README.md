# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles that I like to always use on any device.

# Install
To make this work just clone this directory somewhere. Then you have to install `GNU stow` (e.g. by using your package manager). Then you just run `stow .` inside of the cloned directory and it will link all the dot files correctly to the `$HOME` directory. 
If this throws an error you might have to delete the files and directories if they are already available.
